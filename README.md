## Create a small grid layout with media queries:

- .col-4 - consumes 33% of the width when the screen size is greater than 960 pixels, 50% of the width when the screen size is greater than 765 pixels and 100% of the width when the screen size is less than 765 pixels.

- .col-6 - consumes 50% of the width when the screen size is greater than 960 pixels and 100% of the width when the screen size is less than 960 pixels

- .col-12 - consumes 100% of the width when the screen size at all sizes.

**Bonus** Style col-4 and col-6 to have different font-sizes, background colors, and font color when they're queries are met.
